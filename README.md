# Hill Climb Racing OOP Project
 Hill Climb Racing is a physics-based driving game where players help Newton Bill — a young, aspiring uphill racer — conquer the world’s most treacherous terrain. From the countryside to the moon, drive a variety of quirky vehicles, upgrade them for max torque, and defy gravity in this addictive, offline-friendly game.  Pull off flips, collect coins, fuel up mid-air (because why not), and whatever you do — don’t. run. out. of. gas.
